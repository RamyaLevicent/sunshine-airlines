        <!-- Reasons for Flight Cancellations Section -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Why Do Flights Get Cancelled?</h2>
            <p>While we always aim to provide timely and reliable service at Sunshine Airlines, there are times when flights may need to be canceled for various reasons. Flight cancellations are usually due to safety, operational, or regulatory concerns, and our priority is always the well-being of our passengers. Here are the most common reasons why flights may be canceled:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Weather Conditions:</strong> Severe weather, such as thunderstorms, heavy snow, ice, fog, or hurricanes, can create unsafe flying conditions. Poor visibility or strong winds can make it difficult for the aircraft to take off or land safely.</li>
                <li><strong>Technical Issues:</strong> Safety is our highest priority. If an aircraft encounters technical or mechanical issues that cannot be resolved quickly, we will cancel the flight to ensure passengers' safety. These issues can range from engine problems to faulty navigation systems.</li>
                <li><strong>Air Traffic Control Restrictions:</strong> Occasionally, air traffic control may impose restrictions due to overcrowded skies, emergency landings, or other reasons. These restrictions can force airlines to delay or cancel flights to prevent further congestion or accidents.</li>
                <li><strong>Operational and Staffing Issues:</strong> Occasionally, staffing shortages or scheduling conflicts can affect our ability to operate flights. Pilots, flight attendants, and ground crew must adhere to strict rest periods for safety reasons, and last-minute staff unavailability may lead to cancellations.</li>
                <li><strong>Public Health Emergencies:</strong> During pandemics or outbreaks, flights may be canceled due to government-imposed travel bans or health risks. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, several flights were grounded due to global restrictions and safety protocols.</li>
                <li><strong>Security Threats:</strong> In cases where there are security threats, such as bomb threats, suspicious luggage, or terrorist alerts, flights may be canceled or delayed until the threat has been thoroughly assessed and neutralized.</li>
                <li><strong>Low Passenger Demand:</strong> In some cases, particularly on less-frequent routes, airlines may cancel flights if there is insufficient demand. In such cases, passengers are rebooked on the next available flight.</li>
                <li><strong>Labor Strikes:</strong> Airline or airport worker strikes, including pilots, cabin crew, or ground staff, may result in mass flight cancellations. These strikes can arise from labor disputes, wage negotiations, or poor working conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Governmental or Regulatory Decisions:</strong> Occasionally, flights may be canceled due to new regulations, political tensions, or changes in government policies that restrict travel to specific regions or countries.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="alert" style="background-color: #f3e5f5; border-left: 6px solid #ab47bc; padding: 10px;">
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> If your flight is canceled due to any of these reasons, Sunshine Airlines will assist with rebooking, refunds, or compensation as per our policies and local regulations.</p>

        <!-- Detailed Section: Weather-Related Cancellations -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Weather-Related Cancellations</h2>
            <p>One of the most frequent reasons for flight cancellations is inclement weather. Although modern aircraft are designed to withstand a wide range of weather conditions, severe weather can make flying unsafe. Here's how weather impacts flights:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Thunderstorms:</strong> Strong winds, lightning, and turbulence from thunderstorms pose a risk to aircraft. Flights may be delayed or canceled to avoid these storms.</li>
                <li><strong>Snow and Ice:</strong> Heavy snowfall can disrupt airport operations by closing runways, reducing visibility, and making it difficult to taxi aircraft. Ice can also accumulate on planes, requiring de-icing before takeoff.</li>
                <li><strong>Fog:</strong> Dense fog reduces visibility at both takeoff and landing, making it unsafe for pilots to operate aircraft. Many flights may be delayed or canceled until the fog clears.</li>
                <li><strong>Hurricanes and Typhoons:</strong> These major storms can shut down airports entirely, often for days. Flights are typically canceled well in advance to avoid flying into the storm's path.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

            <p>Flight cancellations can be frustrating, but there are ways you can minimize the impact on your travel plans. Here are some helpful tips:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Book Early Flights:</strong> Early morning flights are less likely to be canceled compared to later flights, as they are the first ones out and have less chance of being impacted by cascading delays or operational issues.</li>
                <li><strong>Check Weather Conditions:</strong> Always check the weather at your departure and arrival airports before flying, especially during the winter or hurricane season.</li>
                <li><strong>Purchase Travel Insurance:</strong> Travel insurance can cover unexpected costs like accommodation, meals, and alternative travel arrangements if your flight is canceled.</li>
                <li><strong>Sign Up for Alerts:</strong> Sign up for flight status notifications from Sunshine Airlines to receive real-time updates on your flight, including any cancellations or delays.</li>
                <li><strong>Know Your Rights:</strong> Familiarize yourself with local and international air passenger rights regulations to know what you're entitled to in case of a cancellation.</li>
