            <h2>General Health Guidelines</h2>
            <p>Maintaining good health while traveling is essential for an enjoyable and comfortable journey. At Sunshine Airlines, we aim to provide a safe and healthy travel environment for all passengers. Below are some general health tips you should follow during your flight:</p>

            <h3>Before Your Flight</h3>
            <div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
                <img src="image/Travel Insurance.jpg" alt="Health Tips for Safe Travel" style="max-width: 70%; height: 50%; border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);">
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stay Hydrated:</strong> Drink plenty of water before boarding to avoid dehydration, which is common on long flights due to the low humidity inside the cabin.</li>
                <li><strong>Avoid Heavy Meals:</strong> Consuming large or greasy meals right before your flight can lead to indigestion and discomfort during your journey.</li>
                <li><strong>Medications:</strong> If you take regular medication, ensure you carry them in your hand luggage. Always pack extra in case of delays or disruptions.</li>
                <li><strong>Travel Insurance:</strong> It's advisable to have travel insurance that covers health-related incidents abroad, especially if you are traveling to remote locations.</li>
                <li><strong>Vaccinations:</strong> Depending on your destination, you may need vaccinations for diseases like yellow fever, typhoid, or hepatitis. Check with your healthcare provider.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>During Your Flight</h3>
            <div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">
                <img src="image/Drink water.jpg" alt="Drink Water" style="max-width: 70%; height: 50%; border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);">
            </div>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Drink Water:</strong> The cabin air is dry, so keep sipping water regularly. Avoid excessive consumption of caffeinated or alcoholic drinks as they can cause dehydration.</li>
                <li><strong>Move Around:</strong> To reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), it's important to move around the cabin periodically. Stand up, stretch, or walk down the aisles when possible.</li>
                <li><strong>Use Hand Sanitizer:</strong> Airports and airplanes can harbor germs, so use hand sanitizer frequently, especially after touching surfaces like seat belts, tray tables, or restroom doors.</li>
                <li><strong>Take Deep Breaths:</strong> On long flights, take time to breathe deeply and relax your muscles. Practice mindfulness or light stretches in your seat to avoid stiffness.</li>
                <li><strong>Adjust Your Seat:</strong> Use lumbar support and adjust your seat frequently to promote circulation and prevent back pain during long-haul flights.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="alert">
                <p>Important: If you feel unwell at any time during the flight, notify our cabin crew immediately. We are equipped to handle basic medical emergencies and will assist you accordingly.</p>

                <li><strong>Pre-Flight Health Check:</strong> If you are feeling unwell or have any symptoms such as fever, cough, or difficulty breathing, we recommend postponing your travel until you are fully recovered.</li>
                <li><strong>COVID-19 Testing:</strong> Depending on your destination, you may need to provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test taken within 48â€“72 hours before departure. Check your destination's regulations in advance.</li>
                <li><strong>Vaccination Status:</strong> Some destinations require proof of COVID-19 vaccination for entry. Ensure that you have a valid vaccination certificate, either digital or paper, as required by your destination.</li>
